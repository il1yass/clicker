# Click Counter Automation

This Python script automates the process of setting the counter to 2024 on the Click Counter website (https://clickcounter.io) using Selenium WebDriver.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Selenium WebDriver
- Chrome WebDriver (chromedriver)

## Installation

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system. If not, you can download it from https://www.python.org/.

2. Install Selenium WebDriver using pip:
   ```
   pip install selenium
   ```

3. Download Chrome WebDriver (chromedriver) compatible with your Chrome browser version from https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads.
   - Extract the chromedriver executable from the downloaded archive.
   - Make sure the chromedriver executable is in your system PATH or in the same directory as the script.

## Usage

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.

2. Navigate to the directory containing the script.

3. Execute the script using the following command:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```

4. The script will open a Chrome browser, navigate to the Click Counter website, and automatically set the counter to 2024. It will then print out the time taken to reach the target count.

5. After completing the task, the browser will remain open for an additional 15 seconds before closing automatically.

## Notes

- The script uses Selenium WebDriver to interact with the webpage. Make sure you have a stable internet connection while running the script.
- Ensure that the Chrome WebDriver (chromedriver) executable is compatible with your Chrome browser version.
- The script may require modifications if there are changes to the webpage structure or if the target count changes.
